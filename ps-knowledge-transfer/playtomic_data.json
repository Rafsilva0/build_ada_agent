    "platform": "Playtomic is a global sports technology company, primarily focused on padel and tennis, that connects players with clubs through their mobile application to facilitate court bookings and match organisation. Operating in both B2C (players) and B2B (clubs) markets across nine languages, the company aims to modernise its customer support by transitioning from a rigid, tree-based chatbot provider (Ultimate) to Ada's 100% generative AI platform. Their primary objectives are to achieve near 100% automated resolution for repetitive B2C tasks (match cancellations, refund inquiries), eliminate the heavy manual burden of multilingual content maintenance, and gain actionable insights through real-time API monitoring and advanced conversation analytics.",

Interested in Zendesk MCP for ticket history context (e.g. retrieve previous conversation on same issue). Ada's MCP server is live; MCP Actions (Ada as client) on roadmap.\n• Multi-conversation: Playtomic wants ticket-based conversations for easier retrieval of past topics — Ada does not currently support this. Recommendation: use Zendesk widget if this is critical.\n• Article pre-loading: Ada can surface contextual articles based on page context (e.g. reports page) and generate responses rather than just linking articles.\n• Voice: Wants voice for premium B2B clubs (top 200 in Spain initially). Same agent across all channels. Always disclose AI identity.\n• Pricing discussed: €17k implementation, €0.47/conversation, volume discounts >500k. Commercial challenge around overlap with Ultimate contract (ends Oct 2026).\n• Team: dedicated AE + Consultant + Engineer; weekly → biweekly → monthly cadence; joint Slack channel; 24/7 technical support; QBRs included."
